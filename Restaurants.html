                            Sweet Churro has grown from the love that two Venezuelan business women have for Churros. Using their shrewd business sense, they noticed the lack of Churros in the Irish market. They decided to avail of this opportunity and make their homemade Churros available in Ireland. Their unique love and passion allows them to transform Sweet Churro’s top-secret traditional recipe into crunchy clouds of deliciousness.
