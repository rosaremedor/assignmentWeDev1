                            Once you have tried a well prepared Three Milk Cake, you could certanly add this as a part of your life changing experiences. I’m not even exaggerating with this. To say that this spongy cake sogged in the most delicious milk cream is “good” is a major understatement.
                            
                            You can make this cake the day before and decorate with the meringue just before serving. This way the white topping will be flawless.
                            The tres leches are one of those cakes that gets better the day after when the cake has had more time to absorb the milk cream.
                            You can garnish this cake with powder cinnamon. Some people use fresh fruit. If you decided to use fruit, try to place it only when the cake is going to be served. The water of the fruit will melt the meringue. The last thing that you want is stained holes in your meringue with soggy fruit inside.
