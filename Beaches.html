                                Margarita Island
                            </h2>
                            <hr>
                            For many travelers to Venezuela, Margarita Island is usually one of the first stops on the itinerary. Known as the Pearl of the Caribbean, Margarita Island was "discovered" by Columbus in 1498 and offers several white sand beaches, colonial-era forts and churches and plenty of water sports and activities to keep visitors happy. If you're interested in windsurfing, Margarita Island is the perfect place to visit. Consider going during the dry seasons (November to December, April to May) so that your surfing adventures aren't interrupted by rain.

                                Los Roques Island
                            </h2>
                            <hr>
                            The beaches at Los Roques are beautiful and relatively isolated, though a bit difficult to reach. It's best to fly there directly from the airport in Caracas; flights are typically cheap, and the journey takes just 40 minutes by air. Keep in mind that December, January and February are busy months; this is when locals like to take beach holidays.

                                Playa Colorada, Mochima National Park
                            </h2>
                            <hr>
                            Playa Colorada is another favorite, known for its golden-hued sand, dramatic scenery and crystal-clear waters. Best of all, Playa Colorada is part of Mochima National Park, so be sure to take enough time to explore the area. For a real treat, pay a few extra dollars in addition to your park entrance fee to camp right on the beach.
