                            <hr>
                            Arepas are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. They are basically cornmeal cakes made from pre-cooked cornmeal that are grilled, baked, or fried. Historically, arepas were cooked on a “budare”, a smooth, flat stone on which the arepa is cooked. Once the arepa is cooked, they are split in the center and then filled with beans, cheese or your favorite filling. Because Venezuelan are from have Latin roots and are in the Caribbean, there are names for the favorites fillings, such as "Dotted Queen"(a mixture of ripe avocado, chicken and grated cheese), The Picky (pulled beef with grated cheese), The Teenager (Ham and Grated chesse), among others. You can see the menu and order some from this Venezuelan restaurant Arepas Grill if you live in Dublin South.
